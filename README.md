# Dial Type

Welcome to the **Dial Type** project! This uniquely stupid application requires users to complete typing tests in order to input their phone number. The more accurate and fast you type, the faster you can input your number.

## How It Works

1.  **Start a Typing Test**:
    
    -   Once the application is loaded, you'll see a typing test with randomly generated words.
    -   You can choose the test duration by clicking on the time options (15, 30, or 60 seconds).
2.  **Type the Displayed Text**:
    
    -   Type the words shown on the screen as accurately and quickly as possible.
    -   After each line of text is completed, a new line will appear until the test ends.
3.  **Build Your Phone Number**:
    
    -   As you type, your Words Per Minute (WPM) score is calculated.
    -   The WPM score is used to generate a portion of your phone number.
    -   After each test, a segment of your phone number will appear. Continue typing until your full phone number is inputted.
4.  **Submit or Adjust Your Number**:
    
    -   Once your phone number is fully generated, you can either submit it, undo the last input segment, or reset the entire number to start over.
